<b>These words might all mean the same thing to you.</b> <br/>Perhaps you hear geek, nerd, and dweeb, but we all know these have very important differences. <br/>Knowing the differences also can give you a sense of how deep you want to go on your coding adventure.<br/>
<ul>
<li><b>Coders</b> – Can pretty much figure out it. It’ll work, but it won’t be pretty.</li>
<li><b>Hackers</b> – usually low level folks, skillful, with detailed understanding of some area deeply, often scarily deeply.</li>
<li><b>Programmer</b> – Write code and understand algorithms. Often work alone and well.</li>
<li><b>Developer</b> – Are the best generalists, can use lots of different systems and languages and get them to talk to each other. Are true and broad professionals, work with people, and communicate well.</li>
<li><b>Computer Scientist</b> – Need to be able to prove how computers work, at a theoretical level. Are usually math people also.</li>
</ul>
<br/>
If you are closer to one of these already you can get an idea of which direction to head.
