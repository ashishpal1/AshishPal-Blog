<b>What makes Blockchain a challenging field?</b>

In this post, I will give a rundown of some of the best reasons that  makes Blockchain a challenging field.

<b>1. Math. And a lot of it!</b>

Whether you like it or not, Math is omnipresent where there is an blockchain algorithm functional. Read <a href="https://medium.com/dataseries/explaining-the-math-behind-blockchain-algorithms-98d06e06c2e3">here</a> to believe me.

<b>2. Cryptography - Ain't the name: CRYPTOCURRENCY synonymous with Blockchain?</b>

You need to have a clear understanding of various cryptographic techniques and mechanisms in order to get through the fundamentals of blockchain. Read <a href="https://medium.com/@cryptonia/crypto-101-a-simple-guide-to-understanding-and-researching-cryptocurrencies-1da70896aee4"> here </a>.

<b>3. Programming & Data Structures Skills. Yeah you heard it right!</b>

From Go to Ruby to Javascript to what not. You certainly need to be on top of the stack of programming skills to get through the skin of blockchain applications also called DApps. <a href="https://hackernoon.com/what-skills-do-you-need-to-be-a-blockchain-engineer-c4e77e9de22b">Here</a> is a 6min Hackernoon article that clarifies a lot of skills needed to be on this side of the tech-ocean.


<b>4. Network Architectures - Network is the boss.</b>

Basis consensus, everything is network dependent. You cant ignore the fine art of designing responsive ad fault tolerant networks while building a scalable blockchain.

<b>5. Game theory! You aren't done yet! ;)</b>

Game theory explores how rational people make strategic decisions in different scenarios. Although often conflated with general logic, game theory is based in purely mathematical terms and has applications in any domain where people must coordinate or compete with each other.

Given blockchain mechanics of network interdependence, it should be no surprise that game theoretical thinking is critical for designing cryptocurrencies via its influence on cryptoeconomics.

<b>5. Economy</b>
Cryptocurrencies and the underlying distributed ledger technology have exploded into public consciousness over the last few years, with devotees insisting that the technology will revolutionise financial transactions and ownership data. This column identifies a ‘blockchain trilemma’ whereby no ledger can fully satisfy the three desirable properties of decentralisation, correctness, and cost-efficiency. It further explains how distributed ledgers enhance competition but introduce costs above and beyond the well-known electricity costs.

<b>6. Here comes the final peice of the big blockchain puzzle - Finance!</b>

Without much ado, lets hop over to the best and simplest resource i landed upon for making this point clear. Catch <a href="https://blockgeeks.com/guides/blockchain-and-finance/">this</a> up!

In the end of this script, I leave you with <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/blockchain.asp">this</a> fantabulous resource on understanding the nitti-gritties of Blockchain hosted  by Investopedia.

If you are still with me, Welcome to the world of Blockchain!
