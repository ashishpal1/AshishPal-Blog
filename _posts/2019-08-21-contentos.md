“I have a dream for global content creators, and now we are turning that dream into a reality - A place where every content creator who has a dream can achieve it. It will be the future of global content creators, the future of Contentos.” - Mick Tsai, Co-Founder of Contentos.io

When we talk about social media icons, we usually end up discussing about how much money they make from their content without thinking how tough it is for individual content creators to make a living out of it. They need to spend a lot of time generating content and building their audience on a day to day basis. 
Content aggregating and hosting platforms, such as Youtube, Facebook and Instagram, run a lot of advertisement and the money goes to the platforms. For the content creators on these platforms, the money will have nothing to do with them unless they have an alternate arrangement like Paypal, Patreon etc. It means that though their content has contributed to these platforms, the contribution hasn’t been valued yet, due to centralized monopoly. Contentos comes with a fresh algorithm.
What’s Contentos?
In order to solve problems, which have appeared with a success of digital content platforms such as YouTube, various blockchain projects have emerged. Steemit, the beginning of all those, however, could not experience explosive growth due to unbalanced compensation structure and inconvenient UX.
Contentos is a global content solution based on cutting-edge blockchain technology. It allows digital content to be freely produced, distributed, rewarded, and traded while protecting users’ rights and financial interests. It is a variant of social network that unites creators, allowing them to engage and collaborate. Contentos.io is a blockchain technology based decentralized digital content ecosystem that facilitates all stakeholders including creators, consumers, and advertisers, to earn fair compensation for their contributions.

How Contentos empowers its users?
Users can earn income by creating, recommending and sharing content on Contentos-based apps. Users can also subscribe to exclusive content from creators and / or make donations to them. Community operators have been launched to categorize the content and to flag inappropriate content. Users can also earn cryptocurrency via this role. Being a smart developer, you can also play the role within Contentos Platform to earn income. Bookkeepers are twenty one members, elected by the stakeholders, responsible for block creation and transactions.
Contentos ecosystem facilitates:
1. Verifiable Digital Assets
At present, it is difficult to validate the copyright of current digital assets, as content sources come from everywhere, and it is not easy to trace the flow. Contentos allows data to be stored reliably and securely. Content creators register their copyright and provide original content statements, which can be verified and traced with time stamps.
2. Open and Transparent
Right now, payment channels and content platforms take a huge portion of users’ income, while only a small portion of advertising revenue is going back to content creators. In Contentos, all users can reach to each other directly. All value, including content, tools provided by developers, user contribution and the advertising price will be recorded on the block. The information is visible to the entire network.
3. Better Distribution
Centralized platforms distribute traffic based on revenues. Users generally see the content that the platform wants them to see. In Contentos, everyone’s voice matters. It encourages users to do content filtering and review.
4. Get Paid
As average people, it might be difficult to obtain cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. In this network, you don’t need to understand difficult tech jargon or have expensive hardware to mine the cryptocurrencies. You can get them by creating content or make contribution to communities.
Objectives of Contentos 
1. Decentralized traffic sharing: Contentos will rely on Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning as a means of linkage between content authors and their fans, and consequently, ensure accuracy in marketing. 
2. Incontrovertible credit system:  Quality Content will be rated among fans and also put on blockchain information ecosystem. Each rating score will be used to choose each creators credibility and revenue. Both these factors, i.e. credibility of the creator and revenues will serve as quantification of content and reward instrument to be carried out via smart contracts. 
3. Decentralized based revenue distribution: Smart contract will be used to transparently note down values of contributors like advertisers, producers, the contribution of developers and also ads prices.

Technologies of Contentos 
Contentos is a digital content protocol with objectives of ‘fair distribution of compensation in accordance with content community contributory portion’ and ‘copyright guarantee of content creators’. It records copyrights on contents in blockchain, and executes automatic price selection of contents and profit distribution through AI algorithm. Contentos is a project that ‘Liveme’, with the achievement of sales of 1.3 million dollars in 2017 in the United States, is incubating, and has a close cooperative relationship with. Also, Integration as Contentos ecosystem as DAPP for another short video based social media, ‘Cheez’, of Liveme and ‘Photogrid’, photo decorating app with monthly active users (MAU) of 40 million, are being executed. With these 3 applications, Contentos already secured 60 million MAU to its own ecosystem. 
Contentos has DPOS-iBFT consensus algorithm, which automatically selects 3 consensus algorithms depending on network resource conditions. It is planned to adopt side-chain to solve scalability issue of block chain, as well as cross-chain technology to support interoperability between other digital content protocols. Content audit, recommendation, and AI algorithm for matching are also supported.
Advancement of blockchain technology has to make Contentos to hypothetically execute these following key points: 

1. It possesses sidechain technology that allows DApps to get well functionality through sidechain why not being restricted by the main chain. 
2. Distributed storage space technology which has features that make sure that huge data volume like videos is truly stored on a block and Contentos is that great open source platform on Github that got a high-frequency update too.
3. It has a technology that’s of the mechanism of blockchain achieving interconnection and breaking every single platform of other decentralized projects.

Token market
Contentos has a token called COS, it’ll issue COS — an ethereum blockchain based compliant. COS token will be a means of encouraging users to develop more content and actively contribute to the building of the community and to compensate DApp developers too. On the other hand, when users withhold COS without using them, they’ll be disqualified for a bonus. To obtain a bonus each user will be required to trade their COS among one another. VEST will be produced every time a new block is created and shared to those sharers, uploader, reporter, DAPP developer. It’s fairly frequent to part dividends from user’s rights in the double token system.

COS Token Cycle

 

Conclusion

Contentos is a platform that is great when it comes to using technology for serving content with rewards. It’s a content-based project that does tend to be homogenized among other projects. The all-inclusive open source framework will make a user enjoy their contents and also allow creators to be rewarded for their creativity. Companies with many institutions like Binance will also come along with great exposure for this project.
